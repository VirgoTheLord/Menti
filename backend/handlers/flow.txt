//set the scores using websocket for each user


To Do:
//priority setup a redis pubsub
//makes life so much easier.


//admin routes to start quiz, next-question, end quiz
//maybe do auth, not now maybe get the admin routes to work in general
//leaderboard brodcast- should after every submit show the updated scores of every player in the room together

    Ideally,
    lets say 
    the users/players just directly join by code.
    but admin/creator joins by signup signin 
    so schema should realistically not account for any other roles other than, admin so no need on enum
    the signin and signup endpoint is only ever hit by the admin when he tries to login so dont realistically have to account for users trying to login
    //just give different and independent routes yes.
